Game instructions:
Your drinking a cup of cheap beer when someone challenges you to College Pong! (dumb name I just invented)
The goal of the game is to eliminate all of the opponents cups before they eliminate yours. 
When it is your turn, you can hold down on the screen and wait for the power bar (should be next to the mouse) to go up. 
The higher the bar, the more power. Release to throw the ball.
If you hit one of the opponent's cups you can go again. 
If the opponent knocks down all your cups, you lose.
Don't be distracted by the dancing people around you!
